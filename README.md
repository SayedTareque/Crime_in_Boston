# Crimes in Boston

This project aims to provide insights into the nature and extent of crime in Boston over a period of four years from 2015 to 2018. The dataset includes information about the type of crime, location, time, and other related details. Using Python, the script performs various analyses on the dataset to answer specific questions related to crime trends and patterns. By leveraging techniques such as data cleaning, data visualization, the project provides a comprehensive understanding of the crime landscape in Boston. The insights derived from the analysis can help stakeholders, including law enforcement agencies and policymakers, make informed decisions to enhance public safety and reduce crime rates.

## Data

The dataset used in the notebook contains information on the crimes that occurred in Boston from 2015 to 2018. The data includes the offense group, offense description, date and time of the incident, the street where the incident occurred, and the district where the incident occurred. The dataset used in this project is included in the repository as a CSV file. You can also download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/AnalyzeBoston/crimes-in-boston). If you choose to download the dataset from Kaggle, you will need to update the file path in the Python script accordingly.
## Libraries Used

The following Python libraries were used in the notebook:

- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn


## Conclusion

After analyzing the crimes dataset of Boston from 2015 to 2018, a number of interesting findings were revealed.

In terms of offense group, larceny was found to be the most common crime, followed by other offenses such as vandalism and motor vehicle theft. However, when looking at the offense descriptions, drug offenses were the most frequently committed crime. This information could be useful for law enforcement agencies to allocate resources effectively towards the prevention of these crimes.

Moreover, an analysis of the data revealed that there was a slight increase in the number of crimes committed in 2016 as compared to the other years in the dataset. This finding could be used to investigate the factors that led to this increase and help in developing strategies to prevent a similar increase in the future.

Furthermore, the analysis showed that more crimes were committed during the day as compared to the night, with Friday being the day with the highest number of incidents. This information could be helpful in devising targeted law enforcement strategies for specific days and times.

Finally, the data showed that the most crimes occurred during the summer months of June, July, and August. This information can be used to improve policing efforts and increase surveillance during these months to prevent potential crimes.
