## Data

The dataset used in the notebook contains information on the crimes that occurred in Boston from 2015 to 2018. The data includes the offense group, offense description, date and time of the incident, the street where the incident occurred, and the district where the incident occurred. The dataset used in this project is included in the repository as a CSV file. You can also download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/AnalyzeBoston/crimes-in-boston). If you choose to download the dataset from Kaggle, you will need to update the file path in the Python script accordingly.
## Libraries Used

The following Python libraries were used in the notebook:

- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn


## Conclusion

Through the analysis of the dataset, we were able to gain insights into the crimes that occurred in Boston from 2015 to 2018. We found that larceny and drug offenses were the most common in terms of offense group and offense description, respectively. We also found that there was a slight increase in the number of crimes committed in 2016 compared to the other years in the dataset. Additionally, we discovered that there were more crimes committed during the day than during the night and that Friday was the day with the highest number of incidents. We also found that certain streets and districts had a higher incidence of crime. Finally, we found that on average, the most crimes occurred during the summer months of June, July, and August.
